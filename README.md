# Pontiac-Website
The chosen topic is a car store. Namely, Pontiac car store. The <b>main reason</b> our group has chosen this topic is our mutual love towards cars, especially vintage ones. It has been decided to choose Pontiac car manufacturer, because it does not exist now (it closed in 2009), so there would be no “collisions” with any other existing online car stores available now. 

The <b>target audience</b> is people who consider buying a car, car retailers, or others interested in this sphere. The website will provide all the information about models available, tell the history of the brand, and show main advantages of choosing particularly this manufacturer and other features as well. Our website will not support the actual “buying” option, because throughout different bank systems, personas are not allowed to transfer more than 1M tenge online. Therefore, probably, we will embed the function of pre-order, but not the actual buying. 

The <b>main purpose</b> of a website is to present the brand and give any needed information about cars available to a user. The other features are:
*	History of a Pontiac manufacturer;
*	Car detailed catalog;
*	Contact information and ability to send requests/questions and other ways of communicating;
*	Car parts for sale catalog;
*	Loan calculator;
*	Sales information;
*	Maps and information about dealers, services.
